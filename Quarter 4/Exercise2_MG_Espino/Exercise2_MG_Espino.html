<!-- 
● Refer to the instructions in Module 11.1 for the input fields needed for a sign-up sheet. Using the events that we have learned today, make the sign-up sheet interactive for the user.

● Add a selection element to ask the user for their gender. Add the options “Male,” “Female,” and “Prefer not to mention.”

● Use onblur and onfocus to add red borders to the input elements when the user leaves without any input, and a green border if a value is typed and the user is done with the input element.

● Upon submission of the form, print all the information that the user has provided on a div or p tag at the bottom of the page.

● Use fieldset and legend tag to separate the input part from the output part of the form.

● Include a reset button to clear users input and also the information displayed at the bottom of the page.

● Feel free also to design your own version and add other features that can make use of the HTML events that we have learned today.
