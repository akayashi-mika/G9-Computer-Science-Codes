<!-- 
Create a function that does the following:

● Generates a random number from the interval [0, 1000].

Hint: Remember that Math.random() outputs a random number from [0,1]. Do the corresponding mathematical operations to extend the interval to [0,1000].

● Prints the generated number using the string concatenation. The printing should have the following format:

Randomly generated number: [insert number here]

● Displays the ones, tens, and hundreds digit of that number. Use string operations to display the numbers. The printing should have the following format:

Breakdown: [hundred], [tens], [ones]

Sample output:

Randomly generated number: 458

Breakdown: 400, 50, 8

Clue: There are two ways to do this. The first is by using mathematical operations to separate the ones, tens, and hundreds. The second way is to treat the randomly generated number as string and access the characters individually.
