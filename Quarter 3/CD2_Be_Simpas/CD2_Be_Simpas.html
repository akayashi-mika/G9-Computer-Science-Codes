	<p>Finance, insurance, and commercial services are sectors where the United Kingdom excels. And because they do not have a good trading connection with continental Europe, things have been made much more difficult.</p>

	<p>Because of its museums and fashion industry, Paris is a densely populated city with numerous private and semiprivate businesses in many industries.</p>

	<p>Chemicals, automobiles, and a variety of other manufactured products are produced in Germany and traded all over the world.</p>

	<p>Many corporate investments and foreign direct investments are managed by the United States. Their currency, the dollar, is the world's reserve currency, allowing them to have a high foreign national debt but simultaneously allowing them to innovate due to their geopolitical influence.</p>

	<p>As a result of the reforms, China has a significant economic contribution. Consequently, they became one of the world's most reliable trading partners and resource providers.</p>
