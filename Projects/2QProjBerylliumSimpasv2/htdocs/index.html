  <p style="padding: 10px; border: 1px solid blue; width: 600px; height: 300px;" >Poverty is evident all throughout Philippines, and many individuals are suffering as a result of it. However, it is not considered a serious concern because if it had been, the situation would have improved.The majority of individuals in such crowded urban neighborhoods are laborers who are either unemployed, underemployed, or employed but earning pitiful pay. If poverty renders one more susceptible to infection, then impoverished employees are in significant danger during this pandemic. Additionally, our country's underprivileged communities are frequently underserved. The majority of public restrooms are filthy. As a result, epidemics of dengue fever, malaria, the seasonal flu, and other diseases are common in these areas. Furthermore, many people lost their employment as a result of the pandemic, and as this is their main source of income, poverty increased as a result of the lockdown measures. The impact of COVID-19 on poverty in the Philippines is only temporary, but with the correct policies in place and the easing of lockdown measures as rates and vaccines increase, it might be reduced. The following page would then discuss some possible actions to take in order to help those in need.</p>
